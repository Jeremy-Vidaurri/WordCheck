# WordCheck
A program to check if words are correct according to a self-made dictionary.

## How to run
This program was originally written on [Replit](https://replit.com/@JeremyVidaurriV/Word-Checker). I recommend using this website to see the proper functionality of this program. Simply enter the file that you want to check for spelling mistakes. The program will relay any misspelled words.

## Adding additional words
The program reads words from the words.txt file. It can read any additional words and add it to the binary tree.
